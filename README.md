# Reminder App 

The alarms we set or the reminders we save are to do some important thing at a particular time however most of the things can be done only at a particular place.For example, buying milk on the way home from jogging if this alarm goes off on your rest day then it would be very irritating. Hence in this context our app comes into picture you set the alarm with the milk shop as location and a time window in which you estimate you'll be on your way home.

The location data is only stored on your phone and not sent to any server, hence there is no issue of privacy violation as we do no track the location. We just save the reminders with thier corresponding location.
